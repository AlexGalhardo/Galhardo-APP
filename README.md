   - First Commit: August 02, 2021
   - I started this project using pure JavaScript and Common Modules to learn the basics about NodeJS ecossystem
   - You can se the archived 1.0 version repository here: 

## Live Demo
- **Currently Version: ALPHA**
- You can access: https://galhardoapp.com/
- This live demo use "MAIN" branch
- Last updates and development tests are in "CANARY" branch
- You can use default test inputs already in forms to try 
- Test User
   - email: test@gmail.com
   - password: test123
- **IMPORTANT:**
   - **All transactions in this live demo are made in a SANDBOX Environment**
   - **NO REAL Money Transactions will be made**
